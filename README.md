# <h1>ARFoundation on Android</h1>
# <h2>Depth Scene</h2>
 Access to cpuImage using OcclusionManager, and drawing it in a texture.
 PS. Tried it on OnePlus Nord 1. Most of the texture format that I tried didn't work, that's why I used RFloat. R8 also did work, but the edges in the depth image weren't smooth.
